# SWATCHES

You want to put color swatches in your github README, but it won't render html style attributes, and you can't be bothered to make or host the pngs.

**SVG color swatches as a supernice service** thanks to the wonders of [now.sh](https://now.sh)

Add your `color` at the end of the url, get back an svg square.

For hex codes you have to url encode the `#` with `%23`.

rbg(), hsl(), and colour names are fine.
